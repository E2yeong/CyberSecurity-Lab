    <h1>üêß Why Hackers Prefer Linux</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Linux</strong> is an open-source operating system first developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. 
    Over the past three decades, it has become the backbone of servers, supercomputers, cloud infrastructure, and security research. 
    Unsurprisingly, many hackers and cybersecurity professionals strongly prefer Linux over other operating systems.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Reasons Hackers Use Linux</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1. Dominant in Server Environments</strong>  
        Most enterprises deploy Linux-based servers due to lower licensing costs, stability, and performance. 
        Hackers often target Linux servers, so they must be familiar with Linux to understand, exploit, and secure these systems.</li>
      <li><strong>2. Built-in Networking Tools</strong>  
        Linux distributions include or support powerful networking and packet analysis tools such as <span class="example">nmap</span>, <span class="example">tcpdump</span>, and <span class="example">Wireshark</span>. 
        These are essential for reconnaissance, vulnerability scanning, and network troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>3. Specialized Security Distributions</strong>  
        Linux has countless distributions (distros), with several tailored for hacking and penetration testing:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kali Linux</strong>: The industry standard for penetration testing and ethical hacking.</li>
          <li><strong>Parrot Security OS</strong>: Focused on privacy, secure development, and digital forensics.</li>
        </ul>
        These distros come preloaded with hundreds of tools for ethical hacking, digital forensics, and red teaming.</li>
      <li><strong>4. Open-Source Transparency</strong>  
        Linux is open-source, meaning its source code can be reviewed, modified, and optimized. 
        This makes it easier to customize environments and inspect how things work ‚Äúunder the hood.‚Äù</li>
      <li><strong>5. Stability and Performance</strong>  
        Linux systems are highly stable and can run for years without reboot. 
        This reliability is critical in both enterprise servers and long-term security labs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started: How to Use Linux</h2>
    <p>You do not need to buy a separate Linux computer. Instead, you can install Linux as a <strong>virtual machine</strong> inside Windows or macOS. This allows you to experiment safely without affecting your primary operating system.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install a virtualization platform such as 
        <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank">Oracle VirtualBox</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Download a prebuilt Linux security distribution image, such as 
        <a href="https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines" target="_blank">Kali Linux Virtual Machine</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In VirtualBox, go to <em>File ‚Üí Import Appliance</em> and load the Kali Linux VM file. 
      Once imported, you can start the virtual machine and explore Linux in a safe, isolated environment.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Linux is not only a hacker‚Äôs preferred operating system but also a cornerstone of modern IT infrastructure. 
    Its dominance in servers, abundance of security tools, and specialized penetration testing distributions like Kali Linux make it indispensable in cybersecurity. 
    For aspiring ethical hackers, mastering Linux is not optional‚Äîit is a fundamental step toward understanding systems and building real-world security skills.</p>
