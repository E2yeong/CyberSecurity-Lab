    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Internet has brought tremendous convenience to modern society, but at the same time, it has amplified <strong>cybersecurity risks</strong>. 
    In South Korea, I personally observe a sense of <em>security complacency</em>, where many individuals underestimate the importance of cyber defense.</p>

    <p>To raise awareness and strengthen my own skills, I began studying <strong>hacking</strong>. 
    Although I am still in the learning stage, I believe in sharing knowledge, even in small amounts, to contribute to a broader culture of security awareness.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Definition of Hacking</h2>
    <p><strong>Hacking</strong> refers to the act of obtaining unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or digital information. 
    According to the <em>National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)</em>, it involves circumventing security mechanisms to exploit system vulnerabilities.</p>

    <div class="example">
      <p><strong>Examples include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Logging into an email account without permission</li>
        <li>Accessing or exfiltrating confidential data</li>
        <li>Executing unauthorized operations that the system should block</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Types of Hackers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>White Hat Hackers</strong>: Ethical hackers who use the same techniques as malicious hackers but only with authorization. They perform penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and report weaknesses to improve security. (Legal)</li>
      <li><strong>Black Hat Hackers</strong>: Malicious actors who exploit systems illegally for theft, financial gain, espionage, or sabotage. Their activities include ransomware attacks, identity theft, and data breaches. (Illegal)</li>
      <li><strong>Gray Hat Hackers</strong>: Operate in the middle ground‚Äîaccessing systems without explicit permission but not with malicious intent. They often disclose vulnerabilities to the public or vendors, sometimes raising ethical and legal debates. (Ambiguous)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why Hacking Matters in Modern Society</h2>
    <p>Cyberattacks are increasing globally. According to the <strong>Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report (2023)</strong>, over 80% of breaches involved stolen credentials or weak passwords. 
    This shows that hacking is not just a technical skill, but a <strong>societal challenge</strong> that affects governments, corporations, and individuals alike.</p>

    <p>By studying cybersecurity and ethical hacking, we can: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build more secure applications and infrastructure</li>
      <li>Protect sensitive data from cybercriminals</li>
      <li>Contribute to a culture of security awareness and responsibility</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Hacking itself is a <strong>neutral skill</strong>. Its value depends on <em>intent and context</em>. 
    When used maliciously, it threatens society; when used ethically, it strengthens digital safety. </p>

    <p>My goal as a learner is to continue developing cybersecurity knowledge responsibly and to contribute toward a safer and more resilient digital society.</p>
