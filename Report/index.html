  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>User authentication is a core element of modern information security, and passwords remain the most widely used authentication method. However, numerous studies and industry reports emphasize that passwords suffer from inherent vulnerabilities. This report analyzes the key weaknesses of passwords and provides recommendations for improvement.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Major Password Vulnerabilities</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Predictable Words</h3>
    <p>Using names, birthdays, or simple strings such as ‚Äú123456‚Äù and ‚Äúqwerty‚Äù makes passwords easy to guess through dictionary attacks.</p>
    <p class="source">Source: Verizon DBIR, 2023 ‚Äì ‚Äústolen credentials and weak/guessable passwords remain a leading cause of breaches.‚Äù</p>

    <h3>2.2 Insufficient Length</h3>
    <p>Passwords under 8 characters can be cracked within minutes using modern GPU brute-force attacks. Experts recommend a minimum of 12‚Äì14 characters, preferably as a passphrase.</p>
    <p class="source">Sources: NIST SP 800-63B (2020), Bonneau et al. (2015, CACM).</p>

    <h3>2.3 Password Reuse</h3>
    <p>Reusing the same password across multiple services leads to credential stuffing after one breach.</p>
    <p class="source">Source: Google & Harris Poll, 2019 ‚Äì 52% of users admitted to password reuse.</p>

    <h3>2.4 Simple Patterns</h3>
    <p>Sequential keys (e.g., ‚Äúasdfgh‚Äù), repeated numbers (e.g., ‚Äú111111‚Äù), or common phrases are among the first attempted in automated cracking tools.</p>
    <p class="source">Source: NordPass, Top 200 Most Common Passwords, 2022.</p>

    <h3>2.5 Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h3>
    <p>Passwords alone are vulnerable to phishing and credential theft. Enabling MFA can block over 99% of automated account takeover attempts.</p>
    <p class="source">Source: Google Security Blog, 2019.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Best Practices</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Strengthen Password Length</h3>
    <p>Minimum of 8 characters, ideally long passphrases (12‚Äì14+). Longer passphrases provide exponential protection against brute force.</p>
    <p class="source">Source: NIST SP 800-63B, 2020.</p>

    <h3>3.2 Use Password Managers</h3>
    <p>Password managers generate unique, strong passwords per service, reducing the risk of reuse and human error.</p>
    <p class="source">Source: Google Security Blog, 2021.</p>

    <h3>3.3 Enable MFA</h3>
    <p>Adopt MFA through authenticator apps (OTP), SMS, or hardware security keys (FIDO2/U2F).</p>
    <p class="source">Source: Google Security Blog, 2019.</p>

    <h3>3.4 Regular Monitoring</h3>
    <p>Check for leaked credentials using tools like <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com" target="_blank">Have I Been Pwned</a>, and rotate passwords if exposed.</p>
    <p class="source">Source: Troy Hunt, HaveIBeenPwned Project.</p>

    <h3>3.5 Security Awareness</h3>
    <p>Overcome the mindset of ‚Äúit won‚Äôt happen to me.‚Äù Security requires daily vigilance and awareness training.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Passwords remain the dominant authentication method but carry significant vulnerabilities: short length, reuse, predictability, simple patterns, and lack of MFA. Research from DBIR, NIST, and Google consistently recommends adopting long passphrases, password managers, MFA, regular monitoring, and cultivating a culture of security awareness. Ultimately, these measures align with international standards such as ISO/IEC 27001 and NIST SP 800-63B, reinforcing not only technical defenses but also long-term security culture.</p>
